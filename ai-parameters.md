# Parameters

For tasks like claim verification, the following parameters from the Perplexity API could be useful:

- max_tokens: This parameter can be adjusted to ensure detailed responses that cover all aspects of the analysis.
- temperature: Setting a lower temperature can help generate more precise and less speculative responses.
- top_p: This parameter can be used to control the diversity of responses, ensuring that the most relevant information is prioritized.

Refer to the Perplexity API documentation for more details on these parameters and how to optimize them for specific tasks.
